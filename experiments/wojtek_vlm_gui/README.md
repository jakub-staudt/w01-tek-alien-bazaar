# Experiment: the operator GUI for Wojtek's VLM brain

> **Status: EXPERIMENTAL. Not production; nothing here is deployed to the robot.**
> Nothing here is deployed by `ros/deploy.sh`, and no package here is a
> dependency of `wojtek_bringup`. It runs on the PC next to the simulation
> or next to the robot's ROS 2 graph; launching, arming and disarming the
> robot remain human actions. Interfaces are unstable by definition.

A JavaScript page on http://localhost:8501 (served by `wojtek_vlm_gui.server`) where the operator types a task
("go to the purple pillar"), watches Wojtek's VLM brain work through it
step by step, and keeps the robot's Stand up / Arm / Disarm buttons under
their hand. The brain is `wojtek_nav`'s `vlm_brain_node`
([ros/src/wojtek_nav/README.md](../../ros/src/wojtek_nav/README.md)): it
reads the camera, asks the model, verifies, hands pixels to the resolver
and setpoints to `goto`, and turns to search. This page does none of that.
It is a thin ROS 2 client: two topics out, four topics in, four operator
services.

## How it is wired

```
 operator ──► JS page :8501 (server.py, this experiment, its own container)
                │ task ─────────► /wojtek/vlm/instruction (String) ──► vlm_brain_node ── /v1/chat/completions ──► Ollama on the DGX
                │ STOP ─────────► /wojtek/nav/cancel (Empty) + "" instruction           │ pixel
                │ step log ◄──── /wojtek/vlm/status (JSON, latched)                     ▼
                │ picture ◄───── /wojtek/vlm/annotated (one frame per model call)  pixel_goal_node ──► /wojtek/nav/goal ──► goto_node ──► /cmd_vel
                │ words ◄─────── /wojtek/nav/status, /wojtek/nav/pixel_status           costmap (odom, 6 x 6 m) ──────────┘
                └ Robot buttons ► /wojtek/stand_up, lie_down, arm, enable (services); Disarm and Lie down also send STOP

 pad, Steam Deck, web console, text_commander ──► /cmd_vel too: policy_node keeps the last message, 0.5 s dead-man
```

- The page never publishes `/cmd_vel` (`wojtek_vlm_gui/limits.py` lists
  everything it touches; the tests assert the publisher and subscription
  sets). It shows two pictures: the frame the brain annotated, one per
  model call, and (since 2026-09-26) the camera's own JPEG live, the same
  `/compressed` stream the brain reads. On the bench the page runs on the
  RPi next to the camera, so that stream crosses no wifi; over the robot's
  AP it is a second reader of the JPEG (tens of KB a frame at 640x480).
- The model route is the brain's, not the page's: `VLM_URL` and
  `VLM_MODEL` in the repo-root `.env`, read by `ros/sim.sh` into the
  `wojtek_robot` container and by `brain.launch.py`. The only inference
  route is Ollama on the DGX, reached through an ssh tunnel from the PC.
- Arming stays a human button. Disarm and Lie down also STOP the brain,
  because disarming stops the motors, not a task that would otherwise
  keep publishing goals into a disarmed robot.

## Run it (simulation)

```bash
# 0. once per machine
./experiments/wojtek_vlm_gui/run.sh build

# 1. every session: the tunnel to the DGX's Ollama (alias in your ssh config, never in the tree)
ssh -f -N -L 11435:127.0.0.1:11434 <dgx alias>
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:11435/api/tags | head -c 200      # the model tag must be listed
#    root .env: VLM_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11435  VLM_MODEL=qwen3-vl:30b-a3b-instruct

# 2. the sim with Pawel's nav stack and the brain
./ros/sim.sh model_xml:=scene_nav.xml leg_odom:=true nav:=true vlm:=true

# 3. the page
./experiments/wojtek_vlm_gui/run.sh gui        # http://localhost:8501
```

In the page: `Stand up`, then `Arm`, then type the task. Use the
`-instruct` model tags only: Ollama ignores `think=false` on the thinking
tags and every step pays a hidden preamble.

## The camera bench: a person as the robot's legs

For testing the brain on the real camera without the robot walking. The
robot's computer is cabled to the PC and runs only the camera, the
`sysmon_node` and a zenoh bridge (zenoh-plugin-ros2dds) that passes an allow
list of topics over the cable: the colour JPEG, the raw depth, their
camera_info, the load, the drive topics and the four operator services.
Everything else runs on the PC, on its own ROS domain so it never mixes
with a sim session: the other end of the bridge, the real nav stack
(`costmap.launch.py`: costmap, goto, the pixel resolver) on the robot's
depth, the brain, the camera mount transform (from
`wojtek_perception_bringup/config/extrinsics.yaml`), and this page.

The one missing piece is the legs. `./run.sh walker` supplies them: it
integrates `/cmd_vel` into odom -> base_link as if the robot had walked it
(yaw gain 0.76, the gait's 0.38 of the commanded 0.5 rad/s the brain times
its turns by) and publishes a guide the page shows in its **Walk** panel:
an arrow and words for the command (`WALK FORWARD 0.30 m/s`, `TURN LEFT on
the spot, 22 deg/s`, `STAND STILL`), the turn or distance so far, and a
compass to goto's goal from where the robot stands. The person carrying the
camera does what the panel says. Never run the walker next to a real robot:
it publishes a second odom -> base_link.

```bash
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=43 ./experiments/wojtek_vlm_gui/run.sh walker
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=43 ./experiments/wojtek_vlm_gui/run.sh gui     # http://localhost:8501
```

The page is laid out as a chat: the operator's tasks on the right, the
brain's steps on the left in plain words ("I see the chair, heading
there", "Blocked on the way, target 1.6 m away"), each look with the
picture the model answered on, newest at the bottom; the log scrolls
inside the screen and the page itself never grows. The history lives in
the browser (a reload starts with the brain's last task only).
`GET /health` on the server reports each stream's counter and age, the
first place to look when a panel stops moving.

Two bridge traps, both seen on the bench. A latched (transient-local)
topic comes out of the bridge as old messages out of order, so the bench
topics are volatile. And a topic whose only PC-side reader restarts can
lose its route for good: the RPi end drops its reader and never rebuilds
it. Keep one permanent reader on the PC side of any such topic (the bench
does, for `/wojtek/sys/stat`).

Measured on the bench (2026-09-26, RPi 4, D435 on a USB 2 port): colour
640x480 and raw depth 480x270, both at 30 fps from the camera, arrive on
the PC at ~20 fps (the bridge caps them). The camera driver, pinned to
core 0 with the depth filters, point cloud, alignment and RGBD off, fills
that core: ~65 % converting and JPEG-encoding colour at 30 fps (a third
of those frames never leave, the bridge sends 20), ~19 % taking USB
frames, ~13 % kernel interrupt work for USB and for the Ethernet, whose
interrupts also land on core 0. The bridge and `sysmon_node` share core 1
at ~35 %: ~21 % the bridge reading the frames and sending ~5.5 MB/s, the
rest cross-core wake-ups and kernel workers.

## The rule with the pad and the Deck

`/cmd_vel` is shared by every drive source, and `policy_node` keeps
whichever message came last. While a brain task drives, a stick or the
Deck's gate publishes into the same topic and the robot alternates between
the two. **STOP the brain before driving by hand.** Disarm from anywhere
(pad A, the Deck, this page) stops the motors; only this page's Disarm
also ends the task.

## What the page shows

| element | source |
|---|---|
| one line per step: `#3 ask {"type":"goal",...} 1.2s`, `#3 verify ...`, `#3 pixel_goal -> reached target 0.85 m`, `#4 turn 45.0deg (total 90deg)` | `/wojtek/vlm/status` |
| the picture under each `ask` line, with the model's point drawn by the brain | `/wojtek/vlm/annotated` |
| `finished: done` in green, any other result (`gave_up`, `cancelled`, `replaced`, `error ...`, `timeout`) in red | the finishing status |
| `goto: driving`, `pixel: sent` in the sidebar | `/wojtek/nav/status`, `/wojtek/nav/pixel_status` |
| the robot's own answer after every Robot button | the services' responses |
| right column: one bar per core of the computer serving the page (the RT cores marked), load, memory, SoC temperature -- on the bench, the RPi | `/proc/stat`, `/proc/loadavg`, `/proc/meminfo`, the thermal zone |
| right column, below: the camera live, with the frame's size and age; a warning when the driver goes quiet | `/camera/camera/color/image_raw/compressed` |

A task typed while nobody subscribes to the instruction topic (no session
with `vlm:=true`) is refused in the page with a message, never dropped
silently. A stop word (`stop`, empty, the brain's own `stój`) typed as a
task is a STOP.

## Layout

| path | purpose |
|---|---|
| `run.sh` | `build \| up \| down \| shell \| gui \| test` |
| `docker/` | the `wojtek_vlm_gui` image (ros:jazzy-ros-base + a Starlette/uvicorn venv) and compose service (host net, the sim's DDS settings) |
| `wojtek_vlm_gui/limits.py` | every topic and service the page touches; what it never publishes |
| `wojtek_vlm_gui/task_log.py` | the brain's status stream as the page prints it (pure) |
| `wojtek_vlm_gui/brain_client.py` | the ROS 2 node: instruction and cancel out, status, picture and camera JPEG in |
| `wojtek_vlm_gui/sysmon.py` | the computer panel's readers of /proc and /sys (pure) |
| `wojtek_vlm_gui/arm_switch.py` | the operator's service calls |
| `wojtek_vlm_gui/server.py` | the page's server: one ROS node, the page on `/`, the websocket on `/ws` |
| `wojtek_vlm_gui/web/` | the page itself: `index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css` (no build step) |
| `wojtek_vlm_gui/wire.py` | the websocket protocol: JSON text frames, tagged binary frames for the camera, the annotated picture and the depth (pure) |
| `wojtek_vlm_gui/walker.py`, `walker_node.py` | the bench's legs: /cmd_vel integrated into odom->base_link and the page's Walk guide |
| `wojtek_vlm_gui/sysmon_node.py` | the robot's load on `/wojtek/sys/stat`, the only piece that runs on the robot |
| `tests/` | model-free: the log, the client against a mock node, the switch, the machine parsers, the hygiene guard |

```bash
./experiments/wojtek_vlm_gui/run.sh test                      # in the container
EXP_PY=<python with pytest> ./experiments/wojtek_vlm_gui/run.sh test   # on the host: the ROS-free tests, the rest skipped
```

## Isolation rules

1. Nothing outside this directory imports anything inside it, and nothing
   in the root markdown, `ros/`, `training/` or `docs/` names this
   directory (`tests/test_repo_hygiene.py`).
2. `ros/sim.sh`, `ros/dev.sh`, `ros/docker/compose.yaml` are untouched; this
   experiment runs its own compose project next to them.
3. No secrets and no private host identities in the tree: the DGX alias is
   the operator's ssh config, the model endpoint is the gitignored `.env`.

## Physical robot (human-authorized)

The page talks to the robot's graph over the WiFi AP exactly as it talks
to the sim, with the brain running on the PC (`ros2 run wojtek_bringup
robot --web-console --vlm`, the RPi stack with `perception:=true
nav:=true`). Launching, arming and disarming stay human actions outside
this experiment. Not run yet.
